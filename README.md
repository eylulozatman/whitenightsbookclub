My project, which I call white nights book club, aims to increase the sharing of opinions about books by allowing people to share the books they read, make reviews of them and share them with other users.
My project generally consists of 5 pages:
1- A welcome page that welcomes you + registration and login 
2- A home page with an overview of the books 
3- A book detail page where you can read the entire review and also like the review 
4- A book registration page that will allow you to make a new book review 
5- A profile page that includes the book reviews of each use
